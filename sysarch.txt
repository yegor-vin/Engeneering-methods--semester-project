[Filter options list]
Start + Destination
Time - departure|arrival
Transport companies -- [exclude|include [priority-global if breached]] [preferred(priority-local)]
transit lines -- [exclude|include [priority-global if breached]]
vehicle types (train/bus/ship/plane/...) -- [exclude|include [priority-global if breached]] [preferred(priority-local)]
payment methods -- [require|require if known [priority-global if breached]] [preferred(priority-local)]
number of stops -- [min|max [priority-global if breached]]
minimize stops -- priority-global
pass via (stops/places - CONFLICT WITH ROUTE PATH) -- [place 1 [priority-local if breached] [place 2 [priority-local if breached]]... [priority-global if required breached|priority-global if optional only breached]
route length (time/distance/maximize one) -- [[min] [max]]|[maximize time up to(distance/time)|maximize distance up to(distance/time)] [priority-global|priority-global if min/max breached]
number of transfers -- max [priority-global if breached]
minimize transfers -- priority-global
time between transfers -- [[min] [max] [[min per 100m] [max per 100m]]]
distance between transfers -- [min] [max]
minimize walking distance -- priority-global
route path (approximate - from map - CONFLICT WITH PASS VIA) -- priority-global
ticket availability (auto discard if full) -- [class [priority-local if breached]] [maximize emptiness [priority-local]] [priority-globa]

[Filter options "syntax"]
Not really following anything specific, just multiple things combined together.
| - splits mutually exclusive options
[option] - optional option
[option1 [option2]] - option1 is optional, option2 is optional option to option1
CONFLICT WITH - mutually exclusive with named filter option(s)
priority-local - priority of sub-option within single filter option
priority-global - priority accross all primary filter options
filter (text) - text is basically a comment, may list intended uses/options
sublist(priority-local) - list of sub-options where each sub-option accepts separate priority
priority-* if breached - set priority if related conditions cannot be met

[Filter options textual definitions]
Start + Destination = Self descriptive
Time = Time of either departure or arrival

[KaiOS]
Simple online route search only - these are weak devices that can at best use primitive web apps

[User-editable items]
Routes (times, stops, does not exist, new)
Line route (if differs (manual, GNSS))

[Map data source]
OpenStreetMap in snapshots similar to CoMaps, which currently takes them once or twice a month. As of writing, the map of Slovakia is only 347MB in CoMaps.

[Text - Handling of filter data]
1. Filter pool of options based on mandatory options (options excluding priority)
2. Sort used options based on global-priority
3.

[Text - handling of offline data updates]
Offline data will be stored in chunks. Map data by regions, route data by company. Client devices will contact central server periodically or on-demand for list of current data chunk SHA512 hashes. After comparing hashes of stored data (stored in database, pre-computed), and if differing hashes are found, user will be notified to download updates, or they will be automatically downloaded based on user preferences.
Last update times will also be presented, however hashes will be used for comparison to avoid user errors (e.g. new date is entered as older). After download, hashes will be computed for downloaded files to verify their integrity.
P2P download/upload options may be added in the future to off-load bandwidth from our servers to users who are willing to share their bandwidth. This could be based on BitTorrent protocol in combination with NAT traversal techniques such as those used by WebRTC (if not WebRTC itself) to get around CG-NAT or firewalling.

[Text - handling of user-edited content]
This would depend on current number of active users. With larger number of users, requested edits would be shown to other (registered) users who could confirm them. After reaching a certain number of confirmations, the data would get accepted. This number would change based on total number of users. Additionally, only users registered 2 weeks prior to change requests would be allowed to confirm changes.
